# Development Strategy

> **Testing Project Week 2: Favorite Words**

The aim of this project is to practice Javascript with arrays of words, using iteration methods, arrays methods, arrow function and higher order functions. 

Here the users can add their own words to the basic word list, reset all the words, replace the words in the list, check an exact word or check the words by its characters, etc.
